        <br />
        <div>
            Fragforce is the global charity gaming team started at Salesforce that is raising money to support kids facing
            scary stuff like social mistreatment, as well as medical issues such like cancer, cystic-fibrosis and 
            severe accidents.  By rallying our friends, family, and co-workers, we are creating a new philanthropic 
            tradition to support cross-team and community collaboration through a shared 
            love of gaming, all while assisting local hospitals.
