                Fragforce is the global charity gaming team started at Salesforce that is raising money to support kids
                facing
                scary stuff like social mistreatment, medical issues such as cancer, cystic-fibrosis and
                severe accidents. By rallying our friends, family, and co-workers, we are creating a new philanthropic
                tradition to support cross-team and community collaboration through a shared
                love of gaming, all while assisting local hospitals.
