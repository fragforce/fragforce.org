# Fragforce
## About
This is a rewrite of Fragforce.org using Django. 

## Who we are
Fragforce is the global charity gaming team from Salesforce that is raising money to support kids facing scary stuff
like social mistreatment and medical issues (i.e. cancer, cystic-fibrosise, accidents, etc). By rallying our
friends, family, and co-workers, we are creating/facilitating a new philanthropic tradition to boost employee morale
and support cross-team and community collaboration through a shared love of gaming.

## Who we are supporting
Extra Life is a charity organization that is raising money to support Children's Miracle Network (CMN) hospitals
across the country. Extra Life helps games to pledge to play games for 24 hours, and to solicit donations from their
families and friends for CMN in the process.

Child's Play is an international charity organization that seeks to improve the lives of children in hospitals and
domestic violence shelters through the generosity and kindness of the video game industry and the power of play.
