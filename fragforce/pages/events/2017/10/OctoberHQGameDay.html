###So what is this Fragforce anyways?###

Thats a good looking question, fellow!  Fragforce is a fundraising team founded by some Salesforce employees with the goal of helping out kids of all sorts who have had to deal with a lot in their lives, by raising money through playing games of all sorts!  We raise money for several local and international charities, but our primary focus is raising money for Extra Life and UCSF Benioff Children's hospital!

###Okay, so what is Extra Life?###

Extra Life is a Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals fundraising program within the gaming community. Participants fundraise year-round and pledge to game for 24 hours with one goal: to save and improve the lives of sick and injured kids. Funds raised stay local to help pediatric patients at 170 Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals across North America. Since 2008, Extra Life has raised more than $30 million for member hospitals. The movement, formed by gamers bonded by passion, is committed to saving and improving the lives of local kids. 

###That's pretty neat!  You have something going on soon?###

As a matter of fact, we do!  We are holding the SF-HQ official Extra Life Marathon days on  Saturday October 21st and Sunday, October 22nd from 10AM until 10PM at the Rincon Center Cafe in San Francisco!

In this 24 hour marathon, split over two days, gamers of all stripes will be gathering to play nearly any type of game you can think of, from board and card games, to consoles and PCs.  We even have VR setups and dancing and rhythm games if being more active is your style!  Folks attending will be able to participate in raffles and mini-tournaments, smaller pickup games, and even bigger party game events.  Other Salesforce offices will be having their local events as well at this time, so inter-office competitions may be in the cards too!  The whole marathon will be broadcast live via Twitch on the [FragforceSF channel][FFTwitch] as well, so everyone can get in on the fun!

For this event, we have a target goal of raising $10,000 from the San Francisco event, and with Salesforce matching many donations, we hope to take a big chunk out of Fragforce's nationwide goal of $100,000 for the year!  To that effect, we are asking everyone who attends to raise (or donate) a minimum of $25 for each day they will be at the event — though any more put towards our total would be greatly appreciated.
